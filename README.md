# Unreal Voice Engine
The UVE is a middleware that integrates smart assistant technology with Unreal Engine allowing for almost limitless voice control over scenes, assets, and more.

This repo will consist of demo projects, blueprints, and AI skills that facilitate the UVE.

# Core Technologies

Unreal Engine

Mycroft AI

# Getting Started

UVE relies on two main platforms, obviously Unreal Engine being the first.  The other is the completely open source smart assistant platform Mycroft AI.  So to get going you'll want to make sure you have installed Unreal Engine (4.25 or above preferred) - https://www.unrealengine.com

Next you'll need to have Mycroft installed on any machine on the same LAN as your Unreal Engine installation, note that it does not have to be the exact same machine.  Generally Mycroft will run easily on just about any flavor of Linux.  For detailed installation docs refer to the Mycroft "Get Started" page - https://mycroft.ai/get-started/
